# Each component that is being frozen should have a section in this file.
# The `changed` section should pull all the files that are changed
# in order to put an error on the given file if it is changed.

# Please provide a reasoning for each component that is frozen.
# Example entry for `conductor` commented out below:

# # Frozen for audit.
# conductor: &conductor
#   - crates/astria-conductor/src/**

# if new components are added above update the list below to get better
# gh pr level visibility into which files are frozen.
# Example entry for `conductor` commented out below:

# changed:
#   - *conductor
