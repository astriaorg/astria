"""
This script provides a general test to ensure logic common to all sequencer upgrades have executed
correctly. It also invokes checks specific to a single upgrade, as set via the `--upgrade-name`
command line arg.

The chosen upgrade name also decides the image tag to use for the start of the test where a
sequencer network is started before the upgrade is staged. It should generally reflect what is being
run in the Astria Mainnet before the given upgrade is applied.

For details on running the test, see the README.md file in `/system-tests`.
