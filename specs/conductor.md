# Astria Conductor

The Astria Conductor connects the shared sequencer and data availability layers
to the execution layer, where the execution layer is a rollup execution
environment. There is one instance of the Conductor per rollup node.

When a block is received, either from the Sequencer layer or from the DA layer,
the Conductor filters for the transactions that are in the rollup's namespace
and pushes them to the execution layer.

Blocks can be received via either:

- The gossip network from the shared Sequencer
- The data availability layer, requested on a predefined interval

In the first case, the transactions in the block are filtered and pushed to the
execution layer, executed, and added to the blockchain. Brand new blocks are
marked as head and all previous blocks are marked as a soft commitment. In
general, the marking of blocks as safe will happen one block at a time as new
blocks arrive. The block is not finalized until it's received from the data
availability layer.

In the second case, batches of blocks are received from the DA layer and
filtered for the rollup. These blocks are then used to set their corresponding
blocks' commit status on the rollup as finalized.

The exact terminology that a rollup uses for its fork choice rules is up to its
implementation. For example, Geth uses `head`, `safe`, and `final`. The
Conductor uses `head`, `soft`, and `firm`. The fork choice options are mapped
with Geth in the following way:

- `head` -> `head`
- `soft` -> `safe`
- `firm` -> `final`

To update the commitment level of a block on the rollup, it simply sends a
`CommitmentState` message to the rollup node.

## Architecture

The architecture of the Conductor is inspired by the [Actor
Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) with the actors within the
Conductor being the `Driver`, `Reader`, and `Executor`. Each actor operates
concurrently and communicates with the other actors by passing messages. The
Conductor is written in Rust and utilizes the Tokio runtime to achieve this.

### Driver

- Top level coordinator that runs and manages all the subcomponents necessary
  for the Conductor
- Creates the `Reader` and `Executor` actors on startup
- Creates a p2p gossip network for receiving data from the Sequencer network
  - The gossip network uses the
    [astria-gossipnet](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria/tree/main/crates/astria-gossipnet)
- Runs an event loop that handles receiving `DriverCommand`s from other actors
  as well as messages from the gossip network
- Validates and passes Sequencer blocks received from the gossip network to the
  `Executor`

The Driver receives either `Events`
([link](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria/blob/6e71a76fa52c522ffdcabcd9d659e4de765d9d61/crates/astria-gossipnet/src/network_stream.rs#L39))
from the network, or `DriverCommand`s
([link](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria/blob/6e71a76fa52c522ffdcabcd9d659e4de765d9d61/crates/astria-conductor/src/driver.rs#L54))
from the Conductor's internal event loop on a timer. The variants for `Event`
and `DriverCommand` that are relevant to the processing of blocks within the
Conductor are:

- `Event::GossipsubMessage(Message)`
  ([link](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria/blob/6e71a76fa52c522ffdcabcd9d659e4de765d9d61/crates/astria-gossipnet/src/network_stream.rs#L50))
  - The `Message` value within the `GossipsubMessage` contains the Sequencer
    block data from the Astria Sequencer. The `Message` is then parsed to a
    `SequencerBlockData`
    ([link](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria/blob/6e71a76fa52c522ffdcabcd9d659e4de765d9d61/crates/astria-sequencer-types/src/sequencer_block_data.rs#L39)).
    Once transformed, the block data is validated to make sure that the
    proposer for the block is the one expected. It also checks the commit of
    the parent block by verifying that >2/3 staking power of the sequencer
    chain voted for it. The block is then passed to the Executor actor as a
    `ExecutorCommand::BlockReceivedFromGossipNetwork` message which will
    ultimately process and filter the block.
- `DriverCommand::GetNewBlocks`([link](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria/blob/3c4e47dbe1818e4228691d6bfd2b2143a06f1a6e/crates/astria-conductor/src/driver.rs#L54))
  - This message triggers the sending of a `ReaderCommand::GetNewBlocks` to
    the Reader actor to initiate the pulling of data from the DA layer.

### Reader

- Creates a `CelestiaClient` to communicate with the DA layer
- Creates a `TendermintClient` which is used when validating blocks received
- Runs an event loop that handles receiving `ReaderCommand`s that drive data
  retrieval from the DA layer
- Passes the blocks it receives to the `Executor`

The Reader receives a `ReaderCommand::GetNewBlocks`
([link](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria/blob/3c4e47dbe1818e4228691d6bfd2b2143a06f1a6e/crates/astria-conductor/src/driver.rs#L54))
message from the driver. The `CelestiaClient`
([link](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria/blob/3c4e47dbe1818e4228691d6bfd2b2143a06f1a6e/crates/astria-sequencer-relayer/src/data_availability.rs#L244))
is then called from the Reader to get data from the Celestia DA. This data is
then parsed from Celestia blobs into individual partial blocks (consisting of
relevant information needed for validation + the relevant rollup transactions).
The block data is then validated to make sure that the proposer for the block is
the one expected. It also checks the commit of the parent block by verifying
that >2/3 staking power of the sequencer chain voted for it. Each block is then
transformed into a `SequencerBlockSubset`s and handed off to the Executor along
with the command `ExecutorCommand::BlockReceivedFromDataAvailability`, then it
is sent to the rollup for execution.

### Executor

- Runs an event loop that handles receiving `ExecutorCommand`s from both the
  Driver and Reader
- Filters transactions by their rollup namespace and sends them to the rollup
  for execution
- Maps sequencer block hashes to execution block hashes so that it can send
  `firm` commits to the rollup
- Blocks are sent to the execution layer using [Astriaâ€™s GRPC Execution client
  interface](https://buf.build/astria/astria/docs/main:astria.execution.v1alpha1)
  - Rollups utilizing the Conductor must implement this interface
- If a block comes from the DA layer, a "finalize block" message is sent to the
  rollup

The `ExecutorCommand`
([link](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria/blob/eeffd2dc24ec14cbc7a3b3197ec2a3c099a78605/crates/astria-conductor/src/executor.rs#L81))
variants that the Executor receives are as follows:

- `ExecutorCommand::BlockReceivedFromGossipNetwork` commands are received when
  data comes from the Sequencer.
- `ExecutorCommand::BlockReceivedFromDataAvailability` commands are received
  when data comes from the DA layer.

When blocks are received from the gossip network, their transactions are
filtered based on the rollup's namespace, then are sent to the rollup for
execution. The execution hash that is returned from the rollup is then stored in
a hash map for Sequencer block hash -> execution hash.

When blocks are received from the DA layer, the hash map of Sequencer block hash
-> execution hash is checked to see if the block has already passed through the
Conductor from the Sequencer. If the block isn't seen, it is filtered and sent
to the rollup for execution exactly the same way the transactions are sent when
received from the Sequencer, then a message to finalize the block is sent. If
the block is already present in the hash map, just the finalize block message is
sent. After being finalized, the Sequencer block hash -> execution hash entry in
the hash map is deleted.

## Execution Data

### Transaction Filtering

An instance of the Conductor is meant to be run alongside the rollup node.

The `chain_id` that Conductor uses as the rollup's identifier is pulled from the
rollup's config. When a user submits a transaction to be sequenced, they specify
the `chain_id` of its destination.

When a Sequencer block is received from the gossip network, the Conductor
filters the transactions for its chain ID and executes only those transactions
on top of its parent state. See the [astria execution
api](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria/blob/main/specs/execution-api.md) for
more details.

### Data Validation

Data is validated before being sent to the rollup for execution. Validation
occurs in two places:

- When blocks are received from the gossip network, the data is validated in
  `BlockVerifier::validate_sequencer_block_data`, which is called from
  `Driver::handle_network_event`. `validate_sequencer_block_data` shapes the
  data and calls `BlockVerifier::validate_sequencer_namespace_data`.
  - `validate_sequencer_namespace_data` performs the following checks:
    - the proposer of the sequencer block matches the expected proposer for
      the block height from Tendermint
    - the signer of the SignedNamespaceData matches the proposer
    - the signature is valid
    - the root of the merkle tree of all the header fields matches the
      block's block_hash
    - the root of the merkle tree of all transactions in the block matches
      the block's data_hash
    - the inclusion proof of the action tree root inside `data_hash` is
      valid
    - the block was actually finalized, i.e. >2/3 stake signed off on it
- When blocks are fetched from the DA layer, the data is validated in
  `Reader::get_new_blocks` which calls:
  - `BlockVerifier::validate_signed_namespace_data`
    - verifies the block signature and checks that the data was signed by
      the expected proposer for this block height
  - `BlockVerifier::validate_rollup_data`
    - calls `BlockVerifier::validate_sequencer_namespace_data` to perform
      the same checks as when blocks are received from the gossip network,
      described above
    - validates the rollup data inclusion proof; it checks that the rollup
      data received was actually what was included in the Sequencer block
      (that no transactions were added or omitted incorrectly and the
      ordering is correct)

### Soft Commitments

When a Sequencer block is received by the Conductor from the gossip network, it
is assumed to be the `head` of the chain, thus its parent block is designated as
a `soft` commitment. This is also the primary moment in the data life cycle for
Astria that transactions are sent to the rollup for execution.

As mentioned in the [Transaction Filtering](#transaction-filtering) section
above, the only information sent to the rollup is the list of ordered
transactions and the previous execution hash from the rollup. It is the rollup
node's responsibility to build their own specific block from the data provided
and return the execution hash that resulted from adding the new block.

The Conductor keeps a map of Sequencer block hashes to rollup execution hashes
for later matching when blocks are seen in the DA layer.

### Firm Commitments

When the Conductor pulls data from the DA, it compares the Sequencer block
hashes seen with those of the already executed blocks stored in the map
mentioned at the end of the [Soft Commitments](#soft-commitments) section. For
each block seen in DA that matches an executed block, a `FinalizeBlock` message
is sent to the rollup to set those blocks to `final` and the entries in the
execution hash to Sequencer block hash map are cleared.

If blocks are seen in DA data that haven't been seen via gossip, the
transactions in those blocks are filtered for the namespace and sent to the
rollup for execution as well as being set to final.
