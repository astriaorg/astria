# Astria Conductor

The Astria Conductor connects the shared Sequencer and data availability layers to the execution layer. There is one instance of the Conductor per rollup.

When a block is received, either from the Sequencer layer or from the DA layer, the Conductor filters for the transactions that are in the rollup's namespace and pushes them to the execution layer.

Blocks can be received via either:

- The gossip network from the shared Sequencer
- The data availability layer, requested on a predefined interval

In the first case, the transactions in the block are filtered and pushed to the execution layer, executed, and added to the blockchain. Brand new blocks are marked as head and all previous blocks are marked as a soft commitment. In general, the marking of blocks as safe will happen one block at a time as new blocks arrive. The block is not finalized until it's received from the data availability layer.

In the second case, batches of blocks are received from the DA layer and filtered for the rollup. These blocks are then used to set their corresponding blocks' commit status on the rollup as finalized.

The exact terminology that a rollup uses for its fork choice rules is up to its implementation. For example, Geth uses `head`, `safe`, and `final`. The Conductor uses `head`, `soft`, and `firm`. The fork choice options are mapped with Geth in the following way:

- `head` -> `head`
- `soft` -> `safe`
- `firm` -> `final`

The Conductor has no knowledge that Geth uses the above options, it simply sends a `CommitmentState` message to the rollup, and the rollup does the rest.

## Architecture

The architecture of the Conductor is inspired by the [Actor Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) with the actors within the Conductor being the `Driver`, `Reader`, and `Executor`. Each actor operates concurrently and communicates with the other actors by passing messages. The Conductor is written in Rust and utilizes the Tokio runtime to achieve this.

### Driver

- Top level coordinator that runs and manages all the subcomponents necessary for the Conductor
- Creates the `Reader` and `Executor` actors on startup
- Creates a gossip network for receiving data from the Sequencer network
    - The gossip network uses the [astria-gossipnet](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria/tree/main/crates/astria-gossipnet)
- Runs an event loop that handles receiving `DriverCommand`s from other actors as well as messages from the gossip network
- Validates and passes Sequencer blocks received from the gossip network to the `Executor`

The Driver receives either `Events` ([link](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria/blob/6e71a76fa52c522ffdcabcd9d659e4de765d9d61/crates/astria-gossipnet/src/network_stream.rs#L39)) from the network, or `DriverCommand`s ([link](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria/blob/6e71a76fa52c522ffdcabcd9d659e4de765d9d61/crates/astria-conductor/src/driver.rs#L54)) from
the Conductor's internal event loop on a timer. The variants for `Event` and
`DriverCommand` that are relevant to the processing of blocks within the
Conductor are:

- `Event::GossipsubMessage(Message)` ([link](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria/blob/6e71a76fa52c522ffdcabcd9d659e4de765d9d61/crates/astria-gossipnet/src/network_stream.rs#L50))
    - The `Message` value within the `GossipsubMessage` contains the Sequencer
      block data from the Astria Sequencer value for an `Event` is received the
      `Message` is then parsed to a `SequencerBlockData`
      ([link](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria/blob/6e71a76fa52c522ffdcabcd9d659e4de765d9d61/crates/astria-sequencer-types/src/sequencer_block_data.rs#L39)).
      Once transformed, the block data is validated to make sure that the
      validator set correctly agreed on the block, the proposer for the Sequencer
      and the block match, and that the previous commit hash in the block header
      is correct.
      The block is then passed to the Executor actor as a
      `ExecutorCommand::BlockReceivedFromGossipNetwork` message which will
      ultimately process and filter the block.
- `DriverCommand::GetNewBlocks`([link](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria/blob/3c4e47dbe1818e4228691d6bfd2b2143a06f1a6e/crates/astria-conductor/src/driver.rs#L54))
    - This message triggers the sending of a `ReaderCommand::GetNewBlocks` to the
      Reader actor to initiate the pulling of data from the DA layer.

### Reader

- Creates a `CelestiaClient` using the Celestia client implementation from `astria-sequencer-relayer` to communicate with the DA layer
- Creates a `TendermintClient` which is used when validating blocks from the DA
  layer against the Sequencer data
- Runs an event loop that handles receiving `ReaderCommand`s that drive data retrieval from the DA layer
- Passes the blocks it receives to the `Executor`

The Reader receives a `ReaderCommand::GetNewBlocks`
([link](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria/blob/3c4e47dbe1818e4228691d6bfd2b2143a06f1a6e/crates/astria-conductor/src/driver.rs#L54))
message from the driver. The `CelestiaClient`
([link](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria/blob/3c4e47dbe1818e4228691d6bfd2b2143a06f1a6e/crates/astria-sequencer-relayer/src/data_availability.rs#L244))
is then called from the Reader to get data from the Celestia DA. This data is
then parsed from a Celestia blob into individual blocks, each block is then validated to check that the validator set is correct and the
proposer for the block matches the proposer of the Sequencer, and that the previous commit of the current block is correct.
Each block is then transformed into a `SequencerBlockSubset`s and handed off to the Executor as a
`ExecutorCommand::BlockReceivedFromDataAvailability` for transaction filtering, and passing off to the rollup for execution.

### Executor

- Runs an event loop that handles receiving `ExecutorCommand`s from both the
  Driver and Reader
- Filters transactions by their rollup namespace and sends them to the rollup for execution
- Catalogs and matches the block hashes received from the gossip network and the DA layer by rollup namespace so that it can send `firm` commits to the rollup
- Blocks are sent to the execution layer using [Astriaâ€™s GRPC Execution client interface](https://buf.build/astria/astria/docs/main:astria.execution.v1alpha1)
    - Rollups utilizing the Conductor must implement this interface
- If a block comes from the DA layer, a "finalize block" message is sent to the rollup

The `ExecutorCommand` ([link](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria/blob/eeffd2dc24ec14cbc7a3b3197ec2a3c099a78605/crates/astria-conductor/src/executor.rs#L81)) variants that the Executor receives are as follows:

- `ExecutorCommand::BlockReceivedFromGossipNetwork` commands are received when data comes from the Sequencer.
- `ExecutorCommand::BlockReceivedFromDataAvailability` commands are received
  when data comes from the DA layer.

When blocks are received from the gossip network, their transactions are
filtered based on the rollup's namespace, then are sent to the rollup for
execution. The execution hash that is returned from the rollup is then stored in
a hash map for Sequencer block hash -> execution hash.

When blocks are received from the DA layer, the hash map of Sequencer block hash
-> execution hash is checked to see if the block has already passed through the
Conductor from the Sequencer. If the block isn't seen, it is filtered and sent
to the rollup for execution exactly the same way the transactions are sent when
received from the Sequencer, then a message to finalize the block is sent.
If the block is already present in the hash map, just the finalize block message
is sent. After being finalized, the Sequencer block hash -> execution hash entry
in the hash map is deleted.

## Execution Data

### Transaction Filtering

An instance of the Conductor is meant to be run alongside the rollup node.

The `chain_id` that Conductor uses as the rollup namespace is pulled from the rollup's config. As such, the Conductor is only aware of the single namespace of the rollup it is supporting. The `chain_id` or namespace is tracked in the Sequencer block that contains the transactions for the rollup and not in the transactions themselves.

When a Sequencer block is received from the gossip network the Conductor filters the transactions for its namespace and passes only those transaction, and the previous execution hash from the rollup to the execution layer. See the [astria execution api](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria/blob/main/specs/execution-api.md) for more details.

### Data Validation

Data is validated before being sent to the rollup for execution. Validation occurs in two places:

- When blocks are received from the gossip network, the data is validated in Driver's `handle_network_event` using `BlockVerifier::validate_sequencer_block_data`
- When blocks are fetched from the DA layer, the data is validated in Reader's `get_new_blocks` using `BlockVerifier::validate_signed_namespace_data` and `BlockVerifier::validate_rollup_data`

### Soft Commitments

When a Sequencer block is received by the Conductor from the gossip network, it is assumed to be the `head` of the chain, thus its parent block is designated as a `soft` commitment. Data received in this manner has been validated by the Sequencer network, and rollups can trust that the data will not be reverted. This is also the primary moment in the data life cycle for Astria that transactions are sent to the rollup for execution.

As mentioned in the [Transaction Filtering](#transaction-filtering) section above, the only information sent to the rollup is the list of ordered transactions and the previous execution hash from the rollup. It is the rollup node's responsibility to build their own specific block from the data provided and return the execution hash that resulted from adding the new block.

The Conductor keeps a map of Sequencer block hashes to rollup execution hashes for later matching when blocks are seen in the DA layer.

### Firm Commitments

When the Conductor pulls data from the DA, it again filters that data by namespace and compares the block hashes seen there with those of the already executed blocks stored in the map mentioned at the end of the [Soft Commitments](#soft-commitments) section. For each block seen in DA that matches an executed block, a `FinalizeBlock` message is sent to the rollup to set those blocks to `final` and the entries in the execution hash to Sequencer block hash map are cleared.

If blocks are seen in DA data that haven't been seen via gossip, the transactions in those blocks are filtered for the namespace and sent to the rollup for execution as well as being set to final.
