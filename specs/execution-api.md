# Execution API Specification

## Overview

The Execution API is the interface `Conductor` uses to drive deterministic
execution of sequenced blocks in dependent chains. Inspired by other APIs, such
as the Engine API and ABCI Consensus API, it is a chain agnostic mechanism
intended to be very simple to implement. It is a gRPC API which any state
machine can implement and use conductor with to drive their execution to
integrate with the Astria Sequencer.

> Note: this documentation is for the v1alpha2 API which is currently being
> implemented, and some of the documentation is on how it should be implemented,
> not how it is currently.

## Basic Design Principles

The Execution API is a resource based API with two resources: `Block` and
`CommitmentState`. The API is designed to follow basic principles outlined by
aip.dev as best practices for resource based APIs. gRPC has been chosen for the
API due to the wide availability of language implementations which make it easy
to generate client libraries, as well as stubs for server implementations.  

## Conductor Usage

### Startup

Upon startup, conductor needs to know the state of commitments in the state
machine and calls `GetCommitmentState`. If started on a fresh rollup these will
all be the same block. If running against a state machine with previous block
data, Conductor must also track the block hash of any blocks between
commitments, it will call `BatchGetBlock` to get block information between
commitments.

### Execution & Commitments

From the perspective of the sequencer:

- `HEAD` commitments are made every time the sequencer creates a new block at
  height N. Only the `HEAD` blocks can be reorged and they can be updated until
  the N+1 block has been created. Once the N+1 block is received, the block at
  height N is set to `SOFT`
- `SOFT` commitment means that sequencer consensus has full agreement on the
  block.
- `FIRM` commitment indicates that the block has been written and has been
  propagated across the DA network.

When configuring conductor, you can configure the time at which blocks are
executed in your rollup using the `execution_commitment_level` in the config
file. If this is configured to a higher level of commitment, no action will be
taken upon receiving lower commitments.

`CreateBlock` is called to create a new execution chain block when the
`execution_commitment_level` has been reached for a given block. Upon receipt of
a new block, the conductor calls `UpdateCommitmentState` to update the
commitment at the level of the `execution_commitment_level` and any level above
it.

`execution_commitment_level` options, and changes to execution:

- `HEAD` (default)
  - upon receiving a new sequencer block N from sequencer:
    - `UpdateCommitmentState` will be called to update `SAFE` to N-1, then
    - `CreateBlock` will be called with data from the sequencer block N, then
    - `UpdateCommitmentState` will be called again to update the `HEAD` to N
  - upon reading new blocks from DA containing all of blocks K->N-1
    - `UpdateCommitmentState` will be called to update `FIRM` to N-1
- `SOFT`
  - upon receiving a new sequencer block N from sequencer:
    - `CreateBlock` will be called with data from the sequencer block N-1, then
    - `UpdateCommitmentState` will be called again to update the `HEAD` and
      `SAFE` to N
  - upon reading new blocks from DA containing all of blocks K->N-1
    - `UpdateCommitmentState` will be called to update `FIRM` to N-1
- `FIRM`
  - conductor does not need to listen for new blocks from Sequencer
  - upon reading new blocks from DA containing all of blocks K->N-1
    - For each block from K->N-1 (M) :
      - `CreateBlock` will be called with data from the sequencer block M
      - `UpdateCommitmentState` will be called to update `FIRM`, `SAFE` and
        `HEAD` to M

Note: For our EVM rollup, we map the `CommitmentState` to the `ForkchoiceRule`:

- `HEAD` Commitment -> `HEAD` Forkchoice
- `SOFT` Commitment -> `SAFE` Forkchoice
- `FIRM` Commitment -> `FINAL` Forkchoice

## Rollup Implementation Details

### CreateBlock

`CreateBlock` executes a set of given trasactions on top of the chain indicated
by `prev_block_hash`. The following should be respected:

- `prev_block_hash` MUST match hash of the `SOFT` commitment state block, return
  `FAILED_PRECONDITION` otherwise.
- If block headers have timestamps, created block MUST have matching timestamp
- The CommitmentState is NOT modified by the execution of the block.

### GetBlock

`GetBlock` returns information about a block given either it's `number` or
`hash`. If the block cannot be found return a `NOT_FOUND` error.

### BatchGetBlocks

`BatchGetBlock` returns an array of Blocks which match the array of passed in
block identifiers.

- The API endpoint MUST fail atomically, returning either all requested resource
  or a `NOT_FOUND` error.
- The returned objects MUST be in the same order as they were requested.

### GetCommitmentState

Returns the commitment state with execution `Block` information for each level
of commitment.

### UpdateCommitmentState

`UpdateCommitmentState` replaces the `CommitmentState` in the sequencer

- No commitment can ever decrease in block number on the blockchain, if this is
  attempted return a `FAILED_PRECONDITION` error.
- `HEAD` commitments MAY be to blocks which replace the previous `HEAD` with
  same block number.
- `SOFT` and `FIRM` block MUST either increase in block number OR match current
  commitment state block.
- `SOFT` and `FIRM` blocks MUST be members of the block chain starting from
  `HEAD`.
- Block numbers in state MUST be such that `SOFT` + 1 >= `HEAD` >= `SOFT` >=
  `FIRM`, return a `FAILED_PRECONDITION` error if this is not true

stack. Demonstrating what happens between a user submitting a transactions, and
seeing it executed as well as before soft and firm commitments.
