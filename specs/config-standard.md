# Configuration Standard

## Purpose

Define how configuration should be implemented across all services within Astria
services.

## Background

When running a service, it is generally [best practice to store configuration in
environment variables](https://12factor.net/config), without defaults. This
makes it difficult to commit environment specific config, and ensures separation
of configuration and code. It makes it easier to integrate with KMS for secrets,
and container orchestration systems are configured to enable this easily. Not
having defaults ensures configuration is done with intention on a given
environment.

For local development, however, this is often inconvenient. CLI args and
defaults are often easier to manage while running on your local machine.
Additionally, blockchains often have genesis files which need to be coordinated
across a diverse set of decentralized actors. Having files for this type of
configuration is often best, and the configurations may be managed via command
line tools.

This standard is intended to balance the best practice, with the needs of
developers for ease, and some shared configuration.

## Astria Standard

- Configuration in Rust managed via
  [Figment](https://docs.rs/figment/latest/figment/)
- Service Configuration
  - All core configuration via environment variables
    - Environment variables for each service are of the form
      `ASTRIA_<SERVICE>_<CONFIG_PROPERTY>`
  - All services have an example `local.env.example` in the repo
    - can be copied to `.env` to run locally
    - Examples for different environments may exist ie:
      - `devnet.env.example`
  - `.env` files are gitignored in repo
  - Tooling
    - README provides information on running locally, including copying of
      example env file
    - Each service will have a `justfile` to maintain ease of running
      - Loads `.env` via `set dotenv-load`
      - `just copy-env {type}` command to ease copying `.env.example` files
        - default to `local`
      - `just run` as a wrapper to `cargo run` with loaded environment
  - Shared Configuration (ie Genesis)
    - configure via passed in path to `ASTRIA_<SERVICE>_<CONFIG_FILE_TYPE>_PATH`
    - may have example files in repo, pointed to by matching `{ENV}.env.example`
      - `local.genesis.json`
- CLI Configuration
  - Configured via environment variable OR CLI arguments w/ sensible defaults as
    appropriate
    - defaults < environment variable < cli in terms of precedence
  - Is not a wrapper to start a service
    - The CLI should not have a `start` command which accepts args and wraps the
      service binary
