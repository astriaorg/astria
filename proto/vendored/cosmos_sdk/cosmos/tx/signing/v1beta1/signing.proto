// SignMode represents a signing mode with its own security guarantees.
//
// This enum should be considered a registry of all known sign modes
// in the Cosmos ecosystem. Apps are not expected to support all known
// sign modes. Apps that would like to support custom  sign modes are
// encouraged to open a small PR against this file to add a new case
// to this SignMode enum describing their sign mode so that different
// apps have a consistent version of this enum.

  //
  // Currently, SIGN_MODE_EIP_191 is registered as a SignMode enum variant,
