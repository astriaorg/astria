//! This crate contains types and logic for constructing merkle trees and generating proofs of
//! inclusion.
//!
//! This is used by the astria-sequencer to generate a commitment to the rollup data in a block,
//! and for the astria-conductor to validate that the rollup data received was in fact committed to.
