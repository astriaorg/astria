# Astria Composer

Composer sits between a rollup execution node and the Astria Shared Sequencer to
submit transactions. As currently implemented, it follows a websocket on a Geth
Node for new transactions, wraps and signs the bytes into a sequencer
transaction. Composer currently supports gathering transactions from a single
rollup. In the future it may support multiple rollups.

## Running Composer

### Dependencies

We use [just](https://just.systems/man/en/chapter_4.html) for convenient project
specific commands.

### Configuration

Composer is configured via environment variables. An example configuration can
be seen in `local.env.example`.

To copy a configuration to your `.env` file run:

```sh

# Can specify an environment
just copy-env <ENVIRONMENT>

# By default will copy `local.env.example`
just copy-env
```

### Running locally

After creating a `.env` file either manually or by copying as above, `just` will
load it and run locally:

```bash
just run
```
