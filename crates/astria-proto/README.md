# Astria Proto

This repo contains all the protobuf packages for Astria. All rust code generated
from the protobuf files in [`proto/`](`./proto/`) is commited to this repository
and no extra tools are needed to encode to/decode from protobuf.

Only when changing protobuf definitions and regenerating the Rust code from
these (which is done by running an integration test) is extra tooling required.
See below.

## Modifying existing and adding new protobuf

CI verifies that the generated Rust code is in sync with the source protobuf
definitions in CI. The test invoked by `cargo test -p astria-proto build` calls
the `buf` CLI tool and verifies that the Rust code before and after the change
is the same. If not, the test fails and leaves the repository in a dirty state.
Commit the generated Rust code and then rerun the test:

```sh
$ cargo test -p astria-proto build
test build ... FAILED

failures:

$ git commit -am "<message about protobuf changes>"
$ cargo test -p astria-proto build

```

## Protos and Buf Build

[Buf Build](https://buf.build/) is a platform and registry for sharing Protocol
Buffers between team members. It also comes with a set of tools to generate gRPC
servers and clients in a range of languages.

[Astria's published protos](https://buf.build/astria/astria)

## Adding a package

* Create a new folder `proto/astria/<pkg-name>/<version>`.
* Write protos in this folder using the convention name
  `astria.<pkg-name>.<version>`.
* Update `src/proto/mod.rs` to include your new definitions in a module.
* Update `src/lib.rs` to reexport the modules at the crate root.

## Working with Buf locally

### First, install Buf CLI and authenticate yourself

* `$ brew install bufbuild/buf/buf` - using homebrew
  * [other ways to install](https://docs.buf.build/installation)
* `$ buf registry login` - [must first create an API
  token](https://docs.buf.build/tutorials/getting-started-with-bsr#create-an-api-token)

### Building and pushing after making changes in `proto`

* `$ buf build` - [builds the proto files into a single binary
  file](https://docs.buf.build/build/explanation#what-are-buf-images)
* `$ buf push` - pushes a module to the registry

### Generating clients and servers

* `$ buf generate` - generate clients and servers according to the configuration
  in `buf.gen.yaml`
