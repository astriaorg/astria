# Astria-Sequencer

## Dependencies

We use [just](https://just.systems/man/en/chapter_4.html) for convenient project
specific commands.

- rust 1.68
- gcc-12, gcc-12-libs
- go 1.18+

### Building

Because `penumbra-storage:0.54.1` depends on `rocksdb:0.19.0` compilation on gcc
13 will not work.

On arch linux:

```sh
sudo pacman -S gcc12 gcc12-libs
CC=/usr/bin/gcc-12 CXX=/usr/bin/c++-12 cargo build
```

## Running the Sequencer

### Configuration

Composer is configured via environment variables. An example configuration can
be seen in `local.env.example`.

To copy a configuration to your `.env` file run:

```sh

# Can specify an environment
just copy-env <ENVIRONMENT>

# By default will copy `local.env.example`
just copy-env
```

### Install cometbft

Ensure `~/go` is in your `PATH`, or `GOPATH` is set to some other place in your
`PATH`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft
cd cometbft
git checkout origin/v0.37.x
export GOPATH=~/go
make install
```

### Optional: install abci-cli for a bit of CLI testing

In the cometbft/ dir:

```sh
make install_abci
```

### Start the application

In astria-sequencer/:

```sh
just run
```

### Query the app for info

```sh
$ abci-cli info
I[2023-05-16|16:53:56.786] service start    module=abci-client
    msg="Starting socketClient service"
    impl=socketClient
-> code: OK
-> data: astria_sequencer
-> data.hex: 0x626173655F617070
```

To query an address's balance:
```sh
$ abci-cli query --path=accounts/balance/<ADDRESS> 0x00
```

To query an address's nonce:
```sh
$ abci-cli query --path=accounts/nonce/<ADDRESS> 0x00
```

### Start the cometbft node

```sh
# initialize the node
cometbft init

# inside astria-sequencer, update the genesis file to include genesis application state
../../target/debug/astria-sequencer-utils --genesis-app-state-file=test-genesis-app-state.json  --destination-genesis-file=$HOME/.cometbft/config/genesis.json

# set the block time to 15s
sed -i'.bak' 's/timeout_commit = "1s"/timeout_commit = "15s"/g' ~/.cometbft/config/config.toml

# start the node
cometbft start
```

You should see blocks being produced.

You can also use `just` to run the above commands:

```sh
just run-cometbft
```

## Testnet

Check out the `TESTNET.md` file for details on how to run a multi-node sequencer testnet.
