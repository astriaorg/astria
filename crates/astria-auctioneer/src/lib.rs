//! Astria Auctioneer auctions bids for the top slot of a rollup's block.
//!
//! Auctioneer connects to a Sequencer node's
//! `astria.sequencerblock.optimistic.v1alpha1.OptimisticBlock`
//! gRPC interface, a Rollup's
//! `astria.auction.v1alpha1.OptimisticExecutionService`, and
//! a Rollup's `astria.auction.v1alpha.AuctionService`.
//!
//! # Starting an auction
//!
//! Every new proposed sequencer block (that is a block created
//! during Sequencer's CometBFT prepare and process proposal phase)
//! triggers Auctioneer to cancel a still running auction and start
//! a new one.
//!
//! Auctioneer forwards the block it received from Sequencer to its
//! the Rollup for (optimistic) execution, and then selects a winner
//! among the bids that are on top of this optimistically constructed
//! block. The winner is submitted to Sequencer to be included in
//! the next Sequencer block.
//!
//! # How a single auction works
//!
//! Once started, an auction waits for two signals:
//!
//! 1. one to open the auction for bids.
//! 2. the other to start the auction timer.
//!
//! The signal to open the auction for bids is usually given after
//! Auctioneer receives the executed block hash from its connected
//! rollup. Afterwards the running auction starts processing its received
//! bids given an allocation rule (right now first price only).
//!
//! The signal to start the auction timer is usually given after
//! Auctioneer receives a commit message from Sequencer. Once the
//! timer is up, the winner of the auction (if any) is submitted
//! to Sequencer.
//!
//! # Submitting an Auction to Sequencer
//!
//! An Auction is submitted to Sequencer using an ABCI
//! `broadcast_tx_sync` RPC. The payload is a regular
//! `astria.protocol.Tranasaction` signed by the auctioneer's
//! private ED25519 signing key.
//!
//! The moment an auction task starts its timer, it also requests
//! the latest nonce for auctioneer's account from Sequencer. If
//! Sequencer answers within the timer's duration, that nonce is
//! used to submit the winning allocation. If Sequencer does not
//! answer then the auction worker submits the winning bid using
//! the cached nonce of the last successful submission.
