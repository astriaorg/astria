# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Unless otherwise specified, we recommend to only use the most recent minor
version release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not file a public ticket** mentioning the vulnerability.

To disclose a vulnerability, please submit a `Security Advisory` via the
`Security` tab on the impacted repository.

If a repository doesn't have the proper security reporting set up, please email
`security@astria.org` to report the vulnerability.

## Disclosure Policy

Please first submit the vulnerability you discovered using the instructions in
[Reporting a Vulnerability](#reporting-a-vulnerability). Once you have done so,
you may share the details with third parties after either of the following,
whichever is sooner:

- the vulnerability has been fixed and the Astria security team has permitted
  disclosure; or
- 120 days have passed since your submission

### Scope

The scope of this security policy applies to the code repositories under the
[@astriaorg](https://github.com/astriaorg) Github org and any related
infrastructure.

### Rewards

Astria does not have a formal reward policy.
Researchers should not expect compensation for discovering vulnerabilities.
However, we are grateful for all legitimate vulnerability discoveries
and will acknowledge researchers after a fix has been widely deployed.

### Official Communication Channel

All security updates will be communicated via the security advisories in the
corresponding code repository that the vulnerability was reported.

### Feedback on this Policy

If you have suggestions for improving this policy,
please submit a pull request.

### What to Expect from Us

When working with us according to this policy, you can expect us to:

- Extend Safe Harbor protection for your vulnerability research related
  to this policy;
- Work with you to understand and validate your report,
  including providing a timely initial response to the submission;
- Work to remediate discovered vulnerabilities in a timely manner; and
- Recognize your contribution if you're the first to report
  a unique vulnerability that triggers a code or configuration change.

### Ground Rules for Researchers

To encourage vulnerability research and to avoid any confusion between
good-faith hacking and malicious attack, we ask that you:

- Follow this policy and any other relevant agreements.
- Report discovered vulnerabilities promptly.
- Avoid violating privacy, disrupting systems, destroying data,
  or harming user experience.
- Use only specified reporting method and official communication channels.
- Keep vulnerability details confidential until fixed, as per the
  Disclosure Policy.
- Test only in-scope systems and respect out-of-scope
  systems and activities.
- Limit data access when demonstrating a Proof of Concept,
and immediately report any accidental access to sensitive data.
- Interact only with test accounts you own or have explicit permission to use.
- Do not engage in extortion.

### Safe Harbor

When conducting vulnerability research in full compliance with this policy and
all applicable laws, we consider this research to be:

- Authorized in accordance with the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)
 (and/or similar state laws), and we will not initiate or support
 legal action against you for accidental, good faith
 violations of this policy;
- Exempt from the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), and we will not
  bring a claim against you for circumvention of technology controls;
- Exempt from restrictions in our Terms & Conditions that would interfere with
conducting security research, and we waive those restrictions on a limited
basis for work done under this policy; and
- Lawful, helpful to the overall security of the Internet, and
conducted in good faith.

If you're unsure whether your research is consistent with this policy,
please report through our official channels before proceeding.
