# Astria

Astria replaces centralized sequencers, allowing many rollups to share a single
decentralized network of sequencers that’s simple and permissionless to join.
This shared sequencer network provides out-of-the-box censorship resistance,
fast block confirmations, and atomic cross-rollup composability – all while
retaining each rollup’s sovereignty.

This repository contains the custom Astria components that make up the Astria
network. Other components of the Astria network can be found in the
[astriaorg](https://github.com/astriaorg) organization.

To run locally, we utilize a dev-cluster which can be found at
[astriaorg/dev-cluster](https://github.com/astriaorg/dev-cluster).

## Components

* [conductor](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria/tree/main/crates/astria-conductor):
  conducts blocks from the data availability layer to the execution layer.
* [proto](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria/tree/main/crates/astria-proto):
  relevant protobufs for Astria types.
* [sequencer](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria/tree/main/crates/astria-sequencer):
  ABCI application that defines the sequencer state transition logic.
* [sequencer-relayer](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria/tree/main/crates/astria-sequencer-relayer):
  relays blocks from the sequencer chain to the data availability layer.

## Build

To build the relevant Astria binaries, you only need
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed.

Then:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/astriaorg/astria.git
cd astria
cargo build --release
```

### Docker build

To build a docker image locally you will first need docker installed. With
docker installed you can use the following just command:

```sh
# Full command:
just docker-build <CRATE> <TAG=local>
#
# Replace CRATE with what the target binary is ie `astria-sequencer`
# TAG defaults to `local` but can be changed.

# this command will build a local image tagged as 'astria-sequencer:local' 
just docker-build astria-sequencer

# this command will build a local image tagged as 'astria-sequencer:debug' 
just docker-build astria-sequencer debug
```

## Running locally

The entire stack consists of many different binaries. It's recommended to use the
setup located in
[astriaorg/dev-cluster](https://github.com/astriaorg/dev-cluster).

## Testing

To run unit tests:

```sh
cargo test
```

Note that the `astria-proto` generates its code by running tests (and verifying
that nothing changed). In order for its tests to run you also need
[Buf](https://buf.build/docs/installation/) installed.

## Formatting

This project uses [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) to format rust
sources, [taplo](https://github.com/tamasfe/taplo) to format toml files, and
[markdownlint-cli2](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2) for
markdown.

### Rust

```sh
# Install rustfmt
rustup +nightly-2023-08-18 component add rustfmt
# Run rustfmt
just fmt-rust
```

### Toml

```sh
# Install for macOS
brew install taplo
# Install for Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S taplo

# Run
just fmt-toml
```

### Markdown

```sh
# Install for macOS w/ homebrew
brew install markdownlint-cli2
# Install for Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S markdownlint-cli2
# Install with NPM
npm install markdownlint-cli2 --global

# Run
markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md" "#target" "#.github"

# Run with docker
docker run -v $PWD:/workdir davidanson/markdownlint-cli2:v0.8.1 "**/*.md" "#.github"
```
