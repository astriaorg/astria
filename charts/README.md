# Astria Charts

This directory contains Helm charts which can be used to deploy Astria
components, and run the full Astria stack.

## Dependencies

Main dependencies

* docker - <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>

  <https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation>

## Setup

In order to startup you will need to have docker running on your machine

### Configuring Funding of Geth

By default, running this local rollup will fund a wallet address
`0xaC21B97d35Bf75A7dAb16f35b111a50e78A72F30`, which you can add to your
preferred wallet using the private key in
`helm/rollup/files/keys/private_key.txt`. This account should never be used for
anything but test transactions.

To change the wallet account which receives funds, use the `deploy-rollup`
command with the optional arguments `evm_funding_address` and
`evm_funding_private_key`.

```bash
# create control plane cluster
just deploy cluster

# ingress controller
just deploy ingress-controller

# wait for ingress.
just wait-for-ingress-controller

# Deploys Sequencer + local DA
just deploy astria-local

# Deploys a geth rollup chain + faucet + blockscout + ingress
# w/ defaults running against local network
# NOTE - default values can be found in `helm/rollup/values.yaml`
just deploy dev-rollup
# w/ custom name and id
just deploy dev-rollup <rollup_name> <network_id>
# w/ custom name, id, and funding address
just deploy dev-rollup <rollup_name> <network_id> <evm_funding_address> <evm_funding_private_key>

# Delete default rollup
just delete rollup
# Delete custom rollup
just delete rollup <rollup_name>

# Delete the entire cluster
just clean

# Delete local persisted data (note: persisted data disabled by default)
just clean-persisted-data
```

### Faucet

The default rollup faucet is available at <http://faucet.astria.localdev.me>.

If you deploy a custom faucet, it will be reachable at
`http://faucet.<rollup_name>.localdev.me`.

By default, the faucet is funded by the account that is funded during geth
genesis. This key is defined in `./evm-rollup/values.yaml` and is identical to
the key in `./evm-rollup/files/keys/private_key.txt`.

### Blockscout

The default Blockscout app is available at <http://blockscout.astria.localdev.me>.

If you deploy a custom Blockscout app, it will be available at
`http://blockscout.<rollup_name>.localdev.me`.

### Connecting Metamask

* adding the default network
  * network name: `astria`
  * rpc url: `http://executor.astria.localdev.me`
  * chain id: `912559`
  * currency symbol: `RIA`

* adding a custom network
  * network name: `<rollup_name>`
  * rpc url: `http://executor.<rollup_name>.localdev.me`
  * chain id: `<network_id>`
  * currency symbol: `RIA`

### Using a local image

Deployment files can be updated to use a locally built docker image, for testing
of local changes. [here](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria/#docker-build).

Once you have a locally built image, update the image in the relevant deployment
to point to your local image, and upload load it into into the cluster. If you
don't already have a cluster running, first run:

```sh
# create control plane cluster
just deploy cluster
```

Then you can run the load-image command with your image name. For instance, if
we have created a local image `astria-sequencer:local`

```sh
# load image into cluster
just load-image astria-sequencer:local
```

To update the chart to utilize the new image, go to `./sequencer/values.yaml`
update the `images.sequencer` image repo to `astria-sequencer` and the `devTag`
to `local`. You can now deploy the chart with your local image.

## Chart Structure

### Dev vs Prod

All of our charts should run against both the lastest code in monorepo AND
against the latest release. Sometimes, there are configuration changes between
releases though. To manage this in various templates you will see the following
pattern (especially in config maps and genesis files):

```yaml
{{- if not .Values.global.dev }}
// information which should be deleted after next cut release
{{- else }}
// things that are only needed for latest, should be promoted at end of release.
{{- end }}
```

## Running a Smoke Test

You can run a basic smoke test, which deploys the astria components and a basic
rollup, runs a tx e2e to ensure it has executed correctly.

To deploy and run this:

```sh
# only if cluster not already created
> just deploy cluster 
> just deploy smoke-test
# deploys all components needed to run the smoke test
> just run smoke-test
# Runs the smoke test will return failure if fails
> just delete smoke-test
# Clean up deployed test
```

## Examing Deployments

[k9s](https://k9scli.io/) is a useful utility for inspecting deployed
containers, logs and services. Additionally you may interact directly with the
kubernetes API some helpful commands below.

### Helpful commands

The following commands are helpful for interacting with the cluster and its
resources. These may be useful for debugging and development, but are not
necessary for running the cluster.

```sh
# list all containers within a deployment
kubectl get -n astria-dev-cluster deployment <DEPLOYMENT_NAME> -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[*].name}'

# log the entire astria cluster
kubectl logs -n astria-dev-cluster -l app=astria-dev-cluster -f

# log nginx controller
kubectl logs -n ingress-nginx -f deployment/ingress-nginx-controller

# list nodes
kubectl get -n astria-dev-cluster nodes

# list pods
kubectl get --all-namespaces pods
kubectl get -n astria-dev-cluster pods

# to log a container you need to first grab the pod name from above
kubectl logs -n astria-dev-cluster -c <CONTAINER_NAME> <POD_NAME>

# delete a single deployment
just delete -n astria-dev-cluster deployment <DEPLOYMENT_NAME>

# delete cluster and resources
just clean

# example of deploying contract w/ forge (https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry)
RUST_LOG=debug forge create src/Storage.sol:Storage \
  --private-key $PRIV_KEY \
  --rpc-url "http://executor.astria.localdev.me"
```
