# Next Steps for Orderbook Component Integration

## 1. Protocol Buffer Definitions

Create proper protocol buffer definitions in:
- `/proto/protocolapis/astria/protocol/orderbook/v1/types.proto`
- `/proto/protocolapis/astria/protocol/orderbook/v1/action.proto`

Update the transaction action protobuf to include orderbook actions:
- `/proto/protocolapis/astria/protocol/transaction/v1/action.proto`

## 2. Code Integration

### Update Storage Layer
- Extend `StoredValue` enum to include orderbook types
- Add orderbook-specific keys in storage module

### Component Registration
- Register the orderbook component in the application setup
- Update the app module to call init_chain, begin_block, and end_block on the orderbook component

### Action Handling
- Add proper checked actions in the action system
- Implement action registration for orderbook-specific actions
- Connect the orderbook component to the transaction execution flow

### Query Integration
- Integrate orderbook queries with the ABCI query system
- Update query routing to include orderbook-specific queries

## 3. Testing

- Create unit tests for orderbook operations
- Add integration tests for order placement and matching
- Test transaction execution with orderbook actions
- Test all query endpoints

## 4. Documentation

- Add formal documentation for orderbook APIs
- Document protocol buffer schemas
- Create examples of using the orderbook component

## 5. Performance Optimization

- Optimize matching engine for high-frequency trading
- Implement proper indices for efficient orderbook access patterns
- Add caching for common queries

## 6. UI/API Integration

- Add orderbook endpoints to public APIs
- Create example UI for interacting with the orderbook
- Develop SDK methods for orderbook interaction

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a decentralized order book on Astria, with future work focusing on performance optimization, enhanced features, and better integration with the broader Astria ecosystem.
